To experimentally verify the results described above, we ran more than \textbf{3 billion simulations}, generating approximately \textbf{250GB} of data. The code that used to run the simulation and to extract the statistics is available on Github, see \autoref{chap:code} for more details. The full data is also available, see \autoref{chap:data}. 


\section{2D lattice simulation}
\label{sec:2d_lattice_simulation}


We used a $L \times L$ square, periodic lattice, which is topologically equivalent to a torus. Each node has four neighbours: one above it, one to the right, one below, and one to the left. The periodicity is represented by the fact that the right neighbors of the nodes in the rightmost column are the nodes in the leftmost column. Similarly, the left neighbours of the leftmost column are the nodes in the rightmost column, the top neighbours of the topmost row are the nodes in the bottom-most row, and the bottom neighbours of the bottom-most row are nodes in the topmost row.

Each node can be in one of two states: dead or alive. Initially, all nodes are in the alive state. With probability $p$, we change state of each individual node to dead. We then compute and store the set of clusters found in the lattice. A cluster is a set of connected nodes sharing the same state. 

Each cluster can either be a finite or infinite. Since the lattice is periodic, \textbf{a cluster is considered infinite if its 1D extension in either direction is greater than or equal to the size of the lattice $L$}. Otherwise, it is a finite cluster. In other words, we imagine a bounding box around each cluster, and if at least of the dimensions of the box is greater than or equal to $L$, the cluster is infinite. 

We generated around 3000 lattices for each pair $(p, L)$, with $p$ ranging from 0 to 1 (with a higher density near the critical points) and $L$ ranging from 16 to 1024.


\section{Percolation probability}
\label{sec:sim_perc_prob}

A lattice has percolated if it contains at least one infinite cluster. For each $(p, L)$, we count the number of percolating lattices and divide by the total number of lattices simulated to compute the percolation probability.

In \autoref{fig:sim_perc_prob_1}, we plot the percolation probability against the occupation probability $p$ for various lattice sizes.


\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/sim_perc_prob_1.png}
  \caption{Percolation probability curve for various lattice sizes}
  \label{fig:sim_perc_prob_1}
\end{figure}

By visual inspection, we can hypothesize that the curve is a hyperbolic tangent curve: 

$$ 
y(x) = \tanh(x)
$$

We can shift and scale this function so that it's centered at $x=\beta$, and such that it's domain matches our data, i.e. $\mathcal{D}(y) = \left[ 0, 1 \right]$. We'd also like a parameter that controls how steep the transition is between $y=0$ and $y=1$ - this can be done by scaling $x$ by a multiplicative factor $\alpha$. The function becomes

$$ 
y(x) = \frac{\tanh(\alpha(x - \beta)) + 1}{2}
$$ 

In \autoref{fig:sim_perc_prob_2}, we can see the the fitted data points. \autoref{table:sec3_tahn_fit_parameters} contains the precise values.


\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/sim_perc_prob_2.png}
  \caption{Percolation probability with a hyperbolic tangent LMS fit}
  \label{fig:sim_perc_prob_2}
\end{figure}

We notice that the the bigger the lattice, the faster it jumps from $y=0$ to $y=1$. This is consistent with the widely known fact that as L increases, i.e. in the limit $L \rightarrow \infty $, the transition becomes a step function at $p = p_c$. 

Another interesting fact to notice is that with the structure of the function we're fitting, $\beta$ represents the point at which the percolation probability first reaches $\frac{1}{2}$.

These two observations suggest that studying the behaviour of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as a function of the lattice size $L$ might be interesting. We can see the results obtained in \autoref{fig:sim_perc_prob_param_scaling.png}, in a so called finite-size scaling analysis.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/sim_perc_prob_param_scaling.png}
  \caption{Finite-size scaling analysis of the hyperbolic tangent function}
  \label{fig:sim_perc_prob_param_scaling.png}
\end{figure}

We observe a monotonic growth in $\alpha$ as a function of the lattice size $L$. We were able to get a reasonable fit by using the ansatz

$$ 
    \alpha(L) = a L^n + b
$$

The precise values for the constants $a$, $n$ an $b$ can be seen in \autoref{table:pp_slope_finite_size_scaling_params}.

Of course, 
$$ 
\lim_{L\to\infty} a L^n + b = \infty \hspace{0.5cm} a > 0, n>0
$$

Since $\alpha$ controls how steep the hyperbolic tangent curve is, that is, how fast it goes from 0 to 1, this supports the hypothesis that as we increase $L$, the curve gets arbitrarily close to a step function. 


The parameter $\beta$, on the other hand, behaves differently. We were able to get a fairly good fit by using the ansatz 

$$ 
\beta(L) = c - a e^{-\frac{L^n}{b}}
$$ 

The precise values for $a$, $n$, $b$ an $c$ can be seen in \autoref{table:pp_center_finite_size_scaling_params}. 

It is clear that 
$$ 
\lim_{L\to\infty} c - a e^{-\frac{L^n}{b}} = c
$$

Since $\beta$ represents occupation probability at which the percolation probability reaches 1/2, the limit above allows us to estimate $p_c$, the critical probability of our system - we do so by interpreting $p_c$ as $\beta$ in the limit of an infinite lattice. This value comes out to be $\mathbf{0.5907} \pm 0.006$.
The error estimates for the percolation probability were computed by treating it as a Bernoulli random variable. We used a 99\% confidence interval and the expression 

$$ 
\textrm{Error} = z \sqrt{\frac{\bar{p}(1-\bar{p})}{n}}
$$

where z is the value coming from the z-table for the desired confidence interval (numerically, $z=2.576$), $\bar{p}$ is the mean of the observations, and $n$ is the number of observations\cite{bertsekas2008introduction}.

\section{Percolating cluster strength}
\label{sec:sim_perc_clust_strength}

The percolating cluster strength represents the probability that a randomly picked node belongs to a infinite cluster. This was numerically approximated by counting the number of nodes belonging to the (possibly multiple) infinite clusters and dividing by the total number of nodes. The results obtained can be seen in \autoref{fig:sim_perc_clust_strength_1}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/sim_perc_clust_strength_1.png}
  \caption{Percolating cluster strength versus occupation probability for various lattice sizes.}
  \label{fig:sim_perc_clust_strength_1}
\end{figure}

As discussed in \autoref{sec:th_percolating_cluster_strength}, we expect to see the percolating cluster strength $P(p)$ go from being zero for $p < p_c$ to a non-zero value for $p > p_c$. This is precisely what we see in \autoref{fig:sim_perc_clust_strength_1}. It's also possible to notice that the transition becomes more abrupt for larger lattice sizes, which provides evidence for intuition that this transition approaches a step function as $L \to \infty$.
Unfortunately, we were not able to find an ansatz that approximates this curve well, and therefore can't provide at this time a convincing numerical estimation for the "abruptness" of this transition or how fast it approaches the step function. 





The errors in the calculation of $P(p)$ were estimated by splitting all observations for each $p$ (around 2000) into 20 bins, computing the mean value for $P(p)$ in each bin, and then computing the standard deviation mean values obtained across the different bins.


\section{Mean cluster size}
\label{sec:sim_mean_clust_size}

The mean cluster size $\chi(p)$ represents the average number of nodes in the finite clusters as defined in \autoref{sec:2d_lattice_simulation}. For each simulation, we loop over the finite clusters, adding their sizes. We then divide the sum by the number of finite clusters to get the average in a particular simulation/lattice. Afterwards, we average again, this time over lattices (of course, this averaging is only done over lattices with the same occupation probability $p$ and size $L$). 


The results can be seen in \autoref{fig:sim_mean_cluster_size_1}.



\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/sim_mean_cluster_size_1.png}
  \caption{Mean finite cluster size versus occupation probability for various lattice sizes}
  \label{fig:sim_mean_cluster_size_1}
\end{figure}


As expected, we see a monotonic increase in $\chi(p)$ up to a maximum value, corresponding to some sort of critical value, and then a somewhat faster, monotonic decrease after the maximum. There is also an interesting kink close to $p=0.9$ which we did not investigate further.
The presence of this peak immediately presents itself as an opportunity to check some of the ideas and scaling laws presented in \autoref{sec:th_mean_cluster_size}. 


As a starting point, we study the peak position and height for each lattice size. Our goal is to make an educated guess on how these values change as we increase the lattice size. To estimate the peak height and occupation probability (the peak position), we fitted a parabola to the 10 points closest the numerical peak (the point for which the height is maximum).

\autoref{fig:sim_mean_cluster_size_peak_height} shows the peak height $H$ as a function of the lattice size we obtained from our data, and \autoref{table:pp_mean_cluster_size_peak_values} shows the precise values obtained.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/sim_mean_cluster_size_peak_height.png}
  \caption{Mean cluster size, peak height for various lattice sizes}
  \label{fig:sim_mean_cluster_size_peak_height}
\end{figure}

As expected, the height grows with the lattice size. The ansatz used to fit the curve is
$$ 
H(L) = a \log(bL)^c + d
$$

The precise values of $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ can be seen in \autoref{table:pp_mean_cluster_size_peak_height_finite_size_scaling_params}. Even thought some of the numerical values obtained from the least squares fit show somewhat high variance and correlation with other parameters, this on itself does not present a problem for us here, since we're not interested in estimating any parameter in particular.

Since 
$$
\lim_{L\to\infty} a \log(bL)^c = \infty
$$

This data supports the hypothesis that as we increase $L$, the peaks height does not converge to any finite height, and instead diverges.


Next, we consider the peak position $K$ as a function of the lattice size $L$. While the peak height is expected to diverge, as discussed above, one expects that the peak probability would converge the true percolation threshold $p_c$ as $L$ increases. 
\autoref{fig:sim_mean_cluster_size_peak_position} shows the probability at which the peak is located, $K$, as a function of lattice size, and \autoref{table:pp_mean_cluster_size_peak_positions} shows the numerical values.


\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/sim_mean_cluster_size_peak_position.png}
  \caption{Mean cluster size, peak position for various lattice sizes}
  \label{fig:sim_mean_cluster_size_peak_position}
\end{figure}


The ansatz used in the fit above is again

$$ 
    K(L) = c - a e^{\frac{L^n}{b}}
$$

So we conclude that this is, as predicted, evidence for the percolation threshold converging to a finite numerical value (namely, $c$). The precise values for all the fit parameters can be seen in \autoref{table:pp_mean_cluster_size_peak_position_finite_size_scaling_params}. Using this method, we estimate $p_c$ to be \textbf{0.5986} $\pm$ 0.009 (again, it's worth pointing out that even though some of the parameters present a somewhat high variance, the one that we're interested in, i.e. $c$, has a surprisingly low variance and correlation with other parameters, further supporting our hypothesis).

The errors in the calculation of $\xi(p)$ were estimated by splitting all observations for each $p$ (around 2000) into 20 bins, computing the mean value for $P(p)$ in each bin, and then computing the standard deviation mean values obtained across the different bins. For the peak position and height, we errors were computing by taking the square root of the relevant diagonal term in the covariance matrix obtained from the least squares fit.

\section{Correlation function and correlation length}


Lastly, we turn our attention to the study of the correlation length. These are a quantities of great interest in general. Apart from being relevant in the study of many phenomena, they also have an intuitive interpretation: the correlation function, for example, can be used to assess the distance required between nodes for the values to be effectively uncorrelated. This distance is generally called the correlation length.

For each lattice simulation, the correlation function was estimated by  selecting a large number (approximately 200000) of random node pairs from the lattice, computing the distance between the nodes in the pair, and then checking whether they belong to the same finite cluster. Averaging over all selected pair a given distance $r$ away, this gives us an estimate of the probability of nodes whose distance is $r$ belonging to the same finite cluster, which is the definition of the correlation function $g(r)$. We then average this over many lattices.

To estimate the correlation length $\xi$, we use the fact that
$$ 
 g(r) \propto r^{-\nu} e^{-\frac{r}{\xi}}
$$ 

Which covers both the case in which $p=p_c$, and the case in which $|p - p_c| \ll 1$. It is somewhat surprising that this also provides a good approximation for the correlation function when even $|p - p_c| > 1$.


The results for the correlation function can be seen in \autoref{fig:sim_corr_func_1}, along with the best fit using the ansatz above. Notice that this plot uses a logarithmic scale in the vertical direction. We give a higher weight to points with bigger $r$ - the reason for this is that the approximation gets better the bigger $r$ is (our goal is to approximate $\xi$, and its influence is only relevant for larger values of $r$). So even though the fit is not great for smaller values of $r$, this allows us to see the exponential decay, represented by the fact that the points are fitted to a line, fairly well.


One interesting fact to mention here is that we get much better results if we use the Manhattan distance, as opposed to the Euclidean distance. The reason for this is not completely clear, but we hypothesize that this is because the Manhattan distance better matches the geometry of the lattice - a "diagonal neighbour", for example, is really two time further away than a nearest neighbour, as opposed to $\sqrt{2}$ times further away, which is what the Euclidean distance would give us.

\autoref{fig:sim_corr_length_1} shows the correlation lengths obtained for multiple lattice sizes and occupation probabilities. 


\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/sim_corr_func_2.png}
  \caption{Correlation function for various sizes and occupation probabilities logarithmic scale in the vertical direction)}
  \label{fig:sim_corr_func_1}
\end{figure}

There's a couple of interesting things to notice in \autoref{fig:sim_corr_length_1}. 
The first is that errors are greatly increased to the right of the peaks. This happens because the errors in the correlation function increase when the occupation probability is in that range - and that, in turn, happens because as we increase the occupation probability $p$ past the $p_c$, many smaller merge clusters merge into the infinite cluster. So it gets much harder to find two pairs of nodes that are not part of the infinite cluster - essentially causing to correlation function to become closer and closer to being identically zero.

More interestingly, though, is to compare the numerical values for correlation length with the square root of the mean cluster size. The square root is necessary since the mean cluster size is closer to an area, since it gives us the average number of nodes in a cluster. By taking its square root, we obtain some kind of "average linear size". By comparing this with the correlation length, we can see that the difference is bigger closer to the peaks, indicating finite size artifacts start to appear. Farther from the peak (which is also roughly the critical occupation probability), these two values are close to each other, indicating that the size of the lattice is sufficiently large so as to be representative of an infinite lattice.

\end{figure}
    

With this, we finish our analysis of the classical percolation model. Next, we'll look at the so called Mandelbrot percolation model.
