    abstract = {Virus capsids are polymeric protein shells that protect the viral cargo. About half of known virus families have icosahedral capsids that self-assemble from tens to thousands of subunits. Capsid disassembly is critical to the lifecycles of many viruses yet is poorly understood. Here, we apply a graph and percolation theory to examine the effect of removing capsid subunits on capsid stability and fragmentation. Based on the structure of the icosahedral capsid of hepatitis B virus (HBV), we constructed a graph of rhombic subunits arranged with icosahedral symmetry. Though our approach neglects dependence on energetics, time, and molecular detail, it quantitatively predicts a percolation phase transition consistent with recent in vitro studies of HBV capsid dissociation. While the stability of the capsid graph followed a gradual quadratic decay, the rhombic tiling abruptly fragmented when we removed more than 25% of the 120 subunits, near the percolation threshold observed experimentally. This threshold may also affect results of capsid assembly, which also experimentally produces a preponderance of 90 mer intermediates, as the intermediate steps in these reactions are reversible and can thus resemble dissociation. Application of percolation theory to understanding capsid association and dissociation may prove a general approach to relating virus biology to the underlying biophysics of the virus particle.}

abstract = {Abstract Hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein is a model system for studying assembly and disassembly of icosahedral structures. Controlling disassembly will allow re-engineering the 120 subunit HBV capsid, making it a molecular breadboard. We examined removal of subunits from partially crosslinked capsids to form stable incomplete particles. To characterize incomplete capsids, we used two single molecule techniques, resistive-pulse sensing and charge detection mass spectrometry. We expected to find a binomial distribution of capsid fragments. Instead, we found a preponderance of 3 MDa complexes (90 subunits) and no fragments smaller than 3 MDa. We also found 90-mers in the disassembly of uncrosslinked HBV capsids. 90-mers seem to be a common pause point in disassembly reactions. Partly explaining this result, graph theory simulations have showed a threshold for capsid stability between 80 and 90 subunits. To test a molecular breadboard concept, we showed that missing subunits could be refilled resulting in chimeric, 120 subunit particles. This result may be a means of assembling unique capsids with functional decorations.},
