\chapter*{Abstract}

The current state of percolation theory is hard to assess. Research often uses different methods, language and notation, is hard to reproduce, and sometimes even provides conflicting results. We aim to give an overview of the current state of some of the most common and simple percolation models, alongside with open source code that allow the reader to easily reproduce the results presented, as well as present an analysis of a novel model called Stateful Mandelbrot Percolation. We hope to facilitate further research, as well as provide a starting point for anyone interested in the topic.
