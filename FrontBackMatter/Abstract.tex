\chapter*{Abstract}

The current state of percolation theory is hard to assess. Research often uses different methods, language and notation, is hard to reproduce, and sometimes even provides conflicting results. We aim to give a numerically detailed, reproducible overview of the classic 2D percolation problem, along with data and open source code that allow the reader to easily reproduce the results presented, as well as present a simple numerical analysis of the relatively uncommon model called Mandelbrot percolation. We hope to facilitate further research, as well as provide a starting point for anyone interested in the topic.
